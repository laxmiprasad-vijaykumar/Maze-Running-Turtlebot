# Maze-Running TurtleBot ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
This project presents an autonomous maze-solving TurtleBot developed using ROS and a custom-built maze environment. The core logic is based on the left-hand wall-following rule, where the robot consistently keeps its left side in contact with a wall to eventually find the maze exit. The navigation is driven by real-time LIDAR data, which is processed in the mazerunner.py script. Functions within the script determine whether the space in the front, left, or right of the robot is free by analyzing LaserScan data within defined angular rangesâ€”typically Â±10Â° in each direction. A configurable distance threshold (tolerance) is used to assess whether a path is clear. As the robot navigates, it publishes informative messages such as "left is free," "right is free," or "front is free" to indicate its decision-making process. Upon reaching the exit, the robot announces successful completion by publishing "maze solved." This simulation demonstrates fundamental principles in autonomous robot navigation and perception using a simple yet effective wall-following strategy.
